## Notes
1. A view is simply a range. Non owning range
2. Its like a whindow we can set up to view some real data without setting up the infrastructure to store data.
3. Views are cheap to copy and pass around as function parameters by design. 
4. A subset of range. Others are eclipsed. Its like a filter. 
5.
