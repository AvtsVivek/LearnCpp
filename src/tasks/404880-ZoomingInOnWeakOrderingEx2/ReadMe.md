## Notes
1. Here we have a class that does case insensitive string comparision. Two strings are considered equal if they are same irrespective of their case, so `Hello` and `HELLO` are equivlant. 

2. Try with the following as well.

```cpp
CaseInsensitiveString ci_str1("Hello");
CaseInsensitiveString ci_str2("HELLO");
```
and 
```cpp
CaseInsensitiveString ci_str1("Hello");
CaseInsensitiveString ci_str2("ZELLO");
```
