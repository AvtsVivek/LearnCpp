## Notes
1. This is an exercise

2. Base is a One raw object and it's neither a pointer nor a reference to One. If you assign a derived object to base, the compiler is jut going to slice off all derived class info and leave in members that matter only in the One class definition and that's only m_1. Please note however that the info in arguments passed when creating the object will be passed all the way to m_1 in One, hence the 1,10 and 100 we see printed out.
