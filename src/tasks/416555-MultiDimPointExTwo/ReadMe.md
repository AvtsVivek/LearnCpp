## Notes
1. Compiler error. Template instances using a different argument for the non type template parameters are technically two different types. The assignment point_2d = point_3d; is figuratively speaking, like assigning a dog to a cat. They are two fundamentally different things, and the compiler will complain that it can't convert one from the other to be able to cross assign them. The specific compiler error will be different depending on the compiler you are using.
