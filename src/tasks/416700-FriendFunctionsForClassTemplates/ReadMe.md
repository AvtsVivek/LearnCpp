## Notes
1. Four scenerios
   1. Friend class: Non template
   2. Friend class: template
   3. Friend function: Non template
   4. Friend function: template

2. This example shows how to setup a friend function to our own class template. Setup a function template and making a friend of our class template.

3. Friend functions that take a parameter(or more) of our template class. The goal is so that we are able to model on aoperator << for our template class.

4. He is using the term [private parts](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-modern-cpp-20-masterclass/learn/lecture/24464896#overview) at 1:55. This term should not be used, instead private members should be used.

5. Here the function as well as class is a template.
