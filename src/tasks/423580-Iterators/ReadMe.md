## Notes
1. Traversing containers in a unified way, regardless of the internal structure if the container. 
2. Each C++ container usually also defines iterators that traverse it. 
3. They allow you to navigate all kinds of containers using a well defined and unified api

4. Iterators are the glue that tie containers and algotithms. We will see algos later. 
5. An iterator is an object that points to an element inside a container. 
6. Like a pointer, an iterator can be used to access the element it points to and can be moved through the content of the container by dereferencing it.  
7. Each container in the C++ Standard Library provides its own iterator, as well as some methods to retrieve it.
8. Using iterators is quite easy: obtain an instance from a container, move it around where needed and then get the pointed element.
