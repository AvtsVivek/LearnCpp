## Notes
1. Custom iterator Requirements
   1. Your container class needs to be a class template.
   2. The container class has to model iterator types.
   3. Your container needs begin() and end() methods thatreturn those iterators.
   4. The iterators have to model the operators needed by your algorithms.
2. Needs to provide the type aliases expected by the standard template library.
3. These types alias help alogrithms work better. 
4. Modify the box container and make it support input iterators.
