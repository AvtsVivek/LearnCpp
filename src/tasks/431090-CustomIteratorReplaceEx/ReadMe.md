## Notes

1. This is a condensed version of earlier example, where we have both the Iterator as well as ConstIterator was defined simultaneously.   

2. In an eralier example, we have seen, `fill algorithm` needs one of `!=` or `==` operators to work. Any one will do. The same is true for range based for loop as well.

3. In this example we see that the same is true with `find alogrithm` and `copy` as well.
