## Notes
1. Function templates are just blueprints. They are not real C++ code consumed by the compiler. the compiler generates real C++ code by looking at the arguments you call your function templates with 

2. The real C++ function generated by the compiler is called a template instance. 

3. A template instance will be reused when a similar function call(argument types) is issued. No duplicates are generated by the compiler. 

4. To see that has been generated, go to [cppinsights.io](https://cppinsights.io/) and paste the main.cpp file contents(you may remove the cout statements).
