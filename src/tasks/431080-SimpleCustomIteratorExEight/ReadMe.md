# Auto

## Notes

1. This is a condensed version of earlier example, where we have both the Iterator as well as ConstIterator was defined simultaneously.   

2. In an eralier example, we have seen, without != operator, `fill algorithm` does not work. The range based for loop also will not work without the != operator.

3. In this example we see that the `find alogrithm` does not work without == operator.
