## Notes
1. The following copying is an expensive operation. 

```txt
BoxContainer constructor called with capicity: 5
Size of array: 1
Start: --------
BoxContainer constructor called with capicity: 20
BoxContainer copy assignment operator called. Copying 20 items...
BoxContainer object destroyed
End: --------
BoxContainer object destroyed
```

2. In the next eample, we will use rvalues, move semantics.
