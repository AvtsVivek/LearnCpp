# Auto

## Notes
1. The auto function template syntax expands to a function template using decltype(auto) without a trailing return type to deduce the return type. As we've seen before, one drawback of that is that you can't call the function before the compiler sees the return expression in the file. The compiler will fail to deduce the type and throw a compiler error in this case.
