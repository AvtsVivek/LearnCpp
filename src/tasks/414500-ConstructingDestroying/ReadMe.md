## Notes
1. The collection type that we are creating in this example is called `BoxContainer`
2. The container is wraping a collection of things. Its like a box to store things.
3. `BoxContainer` is a container class that provides the features 
   1. Add_Item
   2. Remove_Item
   3. Remove_All

4. We can add `BoxContainer's` up with:
   1. +=
   2. +

5. Additionaly we can :
   1. Steam insert BoxContainer with operator <<
   2. Copy ctor BoxContainer's
   3. Copy assign BoxContainer's

6. We have got a copy ctor for the container. Copy ctors allow us to build objects from other already existing objects.  

7. 

```cpp
BoxContainer::BoxContainer(const BoxContainer &source)
{

}
```
