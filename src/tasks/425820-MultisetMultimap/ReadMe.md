## Notes
1. std::multiset and std::multimap are variants of std::set and std::map that can store duplicates
2. They are still ordered, so operator< and the comparator function like entities are still important. 
3. The rest of the methods are smilar to what we have already seen for std:;set and std::map. The details can be browsed through the documentation.
