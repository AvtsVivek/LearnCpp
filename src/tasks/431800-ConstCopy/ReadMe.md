# Constant Iterators

## Notes
1. Why do we need them in the first place? Consider the following. The following will give error. This is because of the const keyword. 

```cpp
const BoxContainer<int> copy(vi);
```

2. Remove the `const` keyword and it will now compile. 

```cpp
BoxContainer<int> copy(vi);
```
