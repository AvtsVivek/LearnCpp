## Notes
1. This is an exercise.
2. We are creating direct objects and it is very clear to the compiler which print method should be called here. One::print() , Two::print() and Three::print() will be called respectively.

```txt
data [one:1]
data [one:10 two:20]
data [one:100 two:200 three:300]
```
