## Notes
1. The `IsInRange` is a functor. It has an operator to which when a value is passed, it will tell, weather that value is within a `given range`. 
2. That `given range` can be specified when we are creating an object of the IsInRange class like so

```cs
IsInRange<int>(10, 20)
```

So when you pass an value say 13 to the functor, it will return true, because 13 is with the range of 10 and 20.
