# Auto

## Notes

1. This is an exercise
2. By inheriting the Two base constructor from Three, we're telling the compiler to generate a two param constructor that will only initialize m_1 and m_2 and leave m_3 with a junk value if it wasn't in-class initialized. In this case it was in-class initialized and it'll contain jut a zero. Hence the output here.
