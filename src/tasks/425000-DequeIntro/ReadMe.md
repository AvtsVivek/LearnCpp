## Notes
1. The Containers library is a generic collection of class templates and algorithms that allow programmers to easily implement common data structures like queues, lists and stacks. There are two(until C++11)three(since C++11) classes of containers:
   1. sequence containers,
      1. array
      2. vector
      3. implace_vector
      4. deque
      5. forward_list
      6. list
   2. associative containers, and
      1. set
      2. map
      3. multiset
      4. multimap
      5. 
   3. unordered associative containers,
   4. Container adaptors
   5. Views
2. deque stands for double ended queue
