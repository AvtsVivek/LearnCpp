# Auto

## Notes
1. I got a compiler error when I compiled the code with gcc 10 in C++20 mode. But you're not guaranteed to get the same results. Some compilers may just throw a warning and allow the code to compile. The whole point of initialization with {} is to prevent or warn against potential data losses in this case.
