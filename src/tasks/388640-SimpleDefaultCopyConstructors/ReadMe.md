# Auto

## Notes
1. This is a way to create new objects. 

2. Default Copy Constructors: When a copy constructor is not defined, the C++ compiler automatically supplies with its self-generated constructor that copies the values of the object to the new object.

3. So in this example, we are creating a person object p2 from an object that was created earlier which is p1.

```cpp
Person p2(p1);
```

4. But notice, no ctor is called.
