# Auto

## Notes
1. The main purpose of this quizz is to show you how concepts can be used when your fucntion template is split across declaration and definition. We are doing auto type deduction, but the compiler won't have a problem with this as it can take a peak at the trailing return type in the declaration. The code will compile, link, run and produce the output here.
