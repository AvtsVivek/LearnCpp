## Notes
1. A function that takes a call back(callback) function is called a higer order function. Because its somehow sitting on top of another function. 

2. Templated type aliases for function pointers dont work with the typedef syntax. This is another reason to avoid them in new modern cpp code. 

3. Type aliases and Templated type aliases will be introduced in subsequent examples.
