# Decl type

## Notes
1. The function template declaration shows up before the point of the function call. The compiler will be able to carry out return type deduction because it can see the return expression in the function header. The template definition instance will also be generated as a result of the definition showing up in the main.cpp file. The code will compile, link, run and produce the output here.
