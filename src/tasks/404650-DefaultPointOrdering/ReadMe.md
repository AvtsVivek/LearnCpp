# Auto

## Notes
1. All that you need one space ship operator. The rest will be generated by the compiler. 

![Re Write Options](50_50_ReWriteOptioins.jpg)

2. The compiler will use the <=> operator to generate >, >=, <, <=

3. If the operator is defaulted, the compiler will also generate a == operator for you.

4. The compiler then uses == to generate !=

5. The coperators will do memeber wise lexicographical comparison

6. The return type of our <=> operator are auto deduced but it will be one of the three options: std::strong_ordering, std::weak_ordering, std::partial_ordering

7. In this case std::strong_ordering will be deduced, because we will compare int members in the declaration order, and the int type suports storng_ordering by default.  

8. If we have something like the following,

```cpp
(20 < i1); 
```

it will re-write to the following.

```cpp
( 20 <=> i1) < 0
```
