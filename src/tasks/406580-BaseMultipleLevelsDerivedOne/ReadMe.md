## Notes
1. This is an exercise.

2. While d1 is an object of Derived_1, it still has a Derived part and a Base part because that's how inheritance works. We're doing public inheritance all the way to the bottom of the hierarchy, so we still have access to the print method from Derived_1 objects. Notice that the print call in main doesn't print m_1,m_2,m_3, because we're getting the print implementation inherited from Derived.
