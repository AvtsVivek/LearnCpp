## Notes
1. This is an exercise.

2. The compilation will fail. 

3. m_z is inherited as part of the private inheritance we're doing from Base. It won't be accessible from the outside like we're trying to do in main. It will however be accessible from Derived objects. It's just that m_z will now be private to Derived in this context.
