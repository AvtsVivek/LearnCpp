## Notes
1. We can pass template type parameters by reference.
2. Earlier we saw we pass template type parameters by value.
3. When we have something like the below, we are passing arguments by value.

```cpp
template <typename T> T maximum_by_val(T a, T b); 
```

4. The addresses we have from the outside are different from the addresses that we have from the inside. 

5. We can also by reference.

```cpp
const T &maximum_by_ref(const T &a, const T &b); // Declaration
```
