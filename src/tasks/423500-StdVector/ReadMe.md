# Auto

## Notes
1. Storing stuff contiguously in memory and providing helper methods to manipulate the data.

2. Containers store elements in different ways.
3. The stl offeres different containes for use in different scenarios to fit your particular use case in the best way possible.
4. Some containers are good for some things and really bad at some other things
5. Choosing the right container for the job is a very strong skill
6. If you dont know before hand which container to choose, pick std::vector. This is a good starting point. 
7. If you need the size, you need to use size() method on the collection. Find size() in the example.
