## Notes
1. References
   1. Dont use dereferencing for reading and writing
   2. Cant be changed to reference something else
   3. Must be initialized at declaration
2. Pointers
   1. Must go throught dereference operator to read and write throught pointed to value
   2. Can be changed to point somewhere else
   3. can be declared un-initialized(will contain garbage)
   4. The dereference operator, also known as the indirection operator, is a symbol used in programming languages to access the value stored at the memory address pointed to by a pointer. It is typically represented by the asterisk (*) symbol.
   5. Use the pointer variable to get the memory address of a variable (used together with the & reference operator). However, you can also use the pointer to get the value of the variable, by using the * operator (the dereference operator).
