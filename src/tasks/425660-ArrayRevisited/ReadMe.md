## Notes
1. std::array is a fixed sie container
2. Elemets are stored contiguously in memory
3. The size is specified at object creation as a non type template parameter
4. Good if you want to enforce that your collections should be of a given size.
5. Good Replacement for the raw arrays, as they have their limitations, like not being able to cross assign them.
