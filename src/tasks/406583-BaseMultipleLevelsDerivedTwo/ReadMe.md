# Auto

## Notes
1. This is an exercise.

2. The compilation will fail. 

3. We are doing protected inheritance from Base and protected inheritance from Derived. m_x,m_y,m_z will be protected to Derived , but m_x,m_y,m_z ,m_a,m_b,m_c will be protected to Derived_1. In fact, anything that was public to Base or Derived will appear protected to Derived_1. Everything being protected, we can't call the methods or access the members like we're trying to do in main, hence the compiler error.
