## Notes
1. The assignment to b will cause for the data to be lost. The fractional part of 20.7 will be stripped off and only 20 will make it into b. At that point we will have arguments of the same type passed to the function template and an int instance will be generated. 20 will be the maximum and it's what'll be printed out.
